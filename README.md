# Click-Chronicles-web-site
 This project represents my first step into web development, combining my newfound coding skills with my passion for design and creativity. It challenged me to understand the fundamentals of building websites.
Click Chronicles is a visually stunning and interactive photography website designed to showcase captivating imagery and creativity. This project serves as a personal portfolio for photographers to display their work and connect with potential clients. It is also my very first web development project, created after diving into the world of coding.
